Structure and philosphy
------------------------------
ThemisPy is a library of utility functions for postprocessing Themis_ analyses.
These have been organized into four packages:

* chain -- Objects and methods for manipulating MCMC chains.
* data -- Objects and methods for processing observational data.
* diag -- Diagnostics.
* vis -- Visualizations of Themis_ analyses.

In addition there two additional top-level directories:

* docs -- Documentation (e.g., what you are reading now).
* scripts -- Python scripts that make use of ThemisPy library functions.
